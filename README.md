# installation
To install the project just clone the whole repository.
# starting with container
To start a containerized version use `docker-compose up -d`.
To stop the container use `docker-compose down`.
Both commands need to be used within the root folder. Docker or podman can be used as containerization plattform.
# starting without container
First install the requirements for python with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
To start the server use `python server.py`.
The client can be started similary with `python client.py`.
All commands need to be used within the "warehouse" folder.
