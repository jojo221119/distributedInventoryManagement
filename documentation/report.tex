\section{Introduction}

As part of the course project an inventory system shall be developed. The system will be a client server architecture where the servers are responsible to keep the data and process updates regarding goods and stock information. The clients can request the currently available goods and the amount and send update information if new goods are available or if goods are taken out of stock. For the updates itâ€™s important to ensure strong consistency and ordering of events such that all clients have the current information. Within the servers it shall be possible to add additional nodes to the system dynamically and to handle different failure cases while still being able to process requests.
