\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:Summary}
Overall we built a warehouse system consisting of a clients and servers. The server nodes can scale horizontally and find other nodes via dynamic discovery. To ensure consistency over all nodes we implemented communication over ordered reliable multicast with total order. The server nodes elect a leader which acts as central point for onboarding new nodes and the ordered reliable multicast. We implemented the bully algorithm for the election. Regarding fault tolerance we implemented mechanisms to detect a system Crash and handle it in a way that does not lead to inconsistencies. An algorithm to handle \ac{BFT} is not implemented in our system.

To sum everything up we built a distributed system implementing a minimum set of protocols and features ensuring scalability and stability. To show the functionality we implemented a small business application on top. In order to use the system in a productive manner it would be necessary to implement further fault tolerance mechanisms and enhance some protocols regarding time and number of messages exchanged.
